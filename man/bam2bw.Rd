\arguments{
\item{bamfile}{The path to the signal bam file.}

\item{output_bw}{The path to the output bigwig file}

\item{bgbam}{The optional path to the control/input bam file to compute 
relative signal (see the `compType` argument).}

\item{paired}{Logical; whether to consider fragments instead of reads for 
paired-end data. For spliced (e.g. RNA-seq) data, paired should always be 
set to FALSE.}

\item{binWidth}{The window size. A lower value (min 1) means a higher 
resolution, but larger file size.}

\item{trim}{The amount by which to trim reads or fragments. Can either be a 
single integer, which will be removed at both ends of the fragment, or an
integer of length=2 indicating the amount to trim at the beginning and end 
of the read/fragments. This is applied before `type` and `extension`.}

\item{extend}{The amount *by* which to extend single-end reads (e.g. 
fragment length minus read length). If `paired=TRUE` and `type` is either
'ends' or 'center', then the extension will be applied after taking the 
(shifted) fragment ends or centers, resulting in ranges of width equal to 
`extend`.}

\item{scaling}{Either TRUE (performs Count Per Million scaling), FALSE (no 
scaling), or a numeric value by which the signal will be divided. If 
`bgbam` is given and `scaling=TRUE`, the background will be scaled to the
main signal.}

\item{shift}{Shift (from 3' to 5') by which reads/fragments will be shifted.
If `shift` is an integer vector of length 2, the first value will represent
the shift for the positive strand, and the second for the negative strand.}

\item{type}{Type of the coverage to compile. Either full (full read/fragment),
start (count read/fragment start locations), end, center, or 'ends' (both
ends of the read/fragment).}

\item{compType}{The type of relative signal to compute (ignored if `bgbam` 
isn't given). Can either be 'log2ratio' (log2-foldchange between signals),
'subtract' (difference), 'log10ppois' (rounded -log10 poisson p-value),
'log10FE' (log10 fold-enrichment). For fold-based signals, `pseudocount` 
will be added before computing the ratio. By default negative values are
capped (see `zeroCap`).}

\item{strand}{Strand(s) to capture (any by default).}

\item{strandMode}{The strandMode of the data (whether the strand is given by
the first or second mate, which depends on the library prep protocol). See
\link[GenomicAlignments]{strandMode} for more information. This parameter 
has no effect unless one of the `strand`, `extend` parameters or a 
strand-specific `shift` are used.}

\item{log1p}{Whether to log-transform (`log(x+1)`) the (scaled) signal.
Ignored when the signal is relative to a background.}

\item{exclude}{An optional GRanges of regions for which overlapping reads 
should be excluded.}

\item{includeDuplicates}{Logical, whether to include reads flagged as 
duplicates.}

\item{includeSecondary}{Logical; whether to include secondary alignments}

\item{minMapq}{Minimum mapping quality (1 to 255)}

\item{minFragLength}{Minimum fragment length (ignored if `paired=FALSE`)}

\item{maxFragLength}{Maximum fragment length (ignored if `paired=FALSE`)}

\item{keepSeqLvls}{An optional vector of seqLevels (i.e. chromosomes) to 
include.}

\item{splitByChr}{Whether to process chromosomes separately, and if so by how
many chunks. The should not affect the output, and is simply slightly 
slower and consumes less memory. Can be a logical value (in which case each
chromosome is processed separately), but we instead recommend giving a 
positive integer indicating the number of chunks.}

\item{pseudocount}{The count to be added before fold-enrichment calculation 
between signals. Ignored if `compType="subtract"`.}

\item{localBackground}{A (vector of) number of windows around each 
tile/position for which a local background will be calculated. The 
background used will be the maximum of the one at the given position or of
the mean of each of the local backgrounds.}

\item{only}{An optional GRanges of regions for which overlapping reads should
be included. If set, all other reads are discarded.}

\item{zeroCap}{Logical; whether to cap values below zero to zero when 
producing relative signals.}

\item{forceSeqlevelsStyle}{If specified, forces the use of the specified 
seqlevel style for the output bigwig. Can take any value accepted by
`seqlevelsStyle`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; whether to print progress messages}

\item{binSummarization}{The method to summarize nucleotides into each bin,
either "max" (default), "min" or "mean".}

\item{...}{Passed to `ScanBamParam`}
}
\value{
The bigwig filepath. Alternatively, if `output_bw=NA_character_`, 
  the coverage data is not written to file but returned.

\details{
* For single-end ChIPseq data, extend reads to the expected fragment size 
  using the `extend` argument (i.e. setting extend to the read length plus 
  the mean expected fragment size).
* For ATAC-seq data, when interested in high-resolution profiling of the Tn5
  insertion sites, it is customary to shift reads based on their strand, i.e.
  using `shift=c(4L,-5L)` and `type="start"`. With paired-end data, we 
  recommend instead using both ends with `type="ends"`. In this case, the 
  shifting should occur from both ends inwards, which is best accomplished 
  with `trim=4L` (rather than using the `shift` argument).
* The implementation involves reading the reads before processing, which can
 be quite memory-hungry. To avoid this the files are read by chunks (composed
  of chromosomes of balanced sizes), controlled by the `splitByChr` argument.
  This reduces memory usage but also creates overhead which reduces the 
  speed. In contexts where the file is small or memory isn't a problem, using 
 `splitByChr=FALSE` will achieve the best speed. Otherwise, increasing 
 `splitByChr` will decrease the memory footprint.
* Consider restricting the read quality using `includeDuplicates=FALSE` 
  and `minMapq=20` for example.
